# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease detection  using VGG16

This project uses **Transfer Learning with the VGG16 model** to classify plant leaf images into 38 different plant disease categories. It is trained using a labeled and augmented dataset from Kaggle and implemented in **TensorFlow and Keras** on **Google Colab**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
- **Classes**: 38 plant diseases
- **Data Type**: Augmented images in `train/` and `valid/` folders
- **Input Size**: Resized to `224 x 224` for VGG16 compatibility

---

## ðŸ§  Model: VGG16 + Custom Classifier

The model uses VGG16 as the feature extractor (without the top layer), and a custom classification head is added to it.

### ðŸ”§ Architecture:
- VGG16 base (frozen during training)
- `GlobalAveragePooling2D`
- `Dense(256, activation='relu')`
- `Dropout(0.5)`
- `Dense(38, activation='softmax')` (for 38 classes)

## ðŸ“Š Training

- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Epochs**: 10 (can be increased)
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

The model was evaluated on the validation set and showed high accuracy and good generalization.
